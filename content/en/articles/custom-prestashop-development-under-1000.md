## What PrestaShop actually brings

When people hear PrestaShop, they think online store. That's fair — it's where it started. But stopping there would be selling it short.

What PrestaShop provides out of the box is a complete infrastructure: user management with access levels, catalog management (products, categories, attributes, variants), pricing rules and conditions engine, order and workflow system, robust back office usable without specific training. All of this exists, is tested, maintained, documented.

That foundation can serve well beyond online retail.

## Uses people don't anticipate

Here are concrete examples of what you can build with PrestaShop and one or two custom modules.

**A B2B catalog with no public prices.** A company that sells exclusively to professionals can have an online catalog accessible only after login, with prices shown according to the customer group. No need to reinvent the wheel — PrestaShop handles all of this natively, a custom module manages access and conditional display.

**An online quote tool.** Instead of a cart and payment, you redirect the process toward generating a quote sent to the sales team. That's exactly what we built on [euro-ceramic.fr](https://euro-ceramic.fr): the guest cart converts into a prospect quote when the form is submitted. Delivered in two days.

**A resource management intranet.** Documents, products, equipment to be booked or ordered internally — PrestaShop can handle this with a front end accessible only to staff, validation workflows, and a back office that managers already know how to use.

**A product configurator.** Options, variants, conditional combinations that lead to a manufacturing request or quote. PrestaShop handles attribute complexity better than most custom-built solutions.

**A supplier portal.** Restricted access per account, recurring order management, history by supplier. PrestaShop's back office replaces a custom-built management tool with something already proven.

## Why this makes financial sense

PrestaShop is open source. No license, no platform subscription. What you pay for is hosting and development.

And on development, AI has changed the equation. The PrestaShop codebase is enormous — too complex for a single developer to know exhaustively without years of intensive work on it. With AI, that barrier disappears. I can develop modules that integrate correctly into PrestaShop's full internal logic, without approximations.

The result: specific developments that used to take several weeks now happen in one to three days. For the majority of needs, the cost stays under €1,000.

## What it doesn't do

PrestaShop isn't the right fit for every project. If you need a native mobile app, real-time data processing, or business logic far removed from catalog and user management, it's probably not the right base.

But if your need revolves around managing objects (products, resources, documents, equipment), users with different access levels, and validation or ordering workflows — PrestaShop deserves serious consideration.

## Let's talk about it

If you have a need in mind and aren't sure where to start, a 30-minute conversation usually determines whether PrestaShop is the right foundation and what it would represent in terms of development. No commitment.
