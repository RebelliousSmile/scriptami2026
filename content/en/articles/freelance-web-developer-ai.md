## The moment it clicked

In 2024, Alex launched the AI Driven Dev training. I joined almost immediately. Not out of curiosity — out of conviction: in this field, you adapt or you disappear. That's been true for every major technological shift, and AI was not going to be an exception.

I didn't wait for others to validate the move. I saw what was happening and decided to go.

## Experimenting before finding the method

Integrating AI into my code came quickly. Finding a method that actually held up was a different story.

I experimented on my own for a long time — my own workflows, my own prompts, my own way of managing context. It worked, but the results stayed below what I wanted to produce.

It was only when I came back to the AI-driven-dev method that things truly aligned. I can say that honestly because I have both sides of the comparison: my own experiments, and what you produce when following a method built collectively by dozens of developers over time. The difference is real.

## What this means for you

A lot of developers lead with the fact that they code faster with AI. That's not my focus.

What I lead with is that I'm more affordable. Projects that used to take me several weeks, I now deliver in one to three days — with fewer bugs, because AI also helps cover the edge cases you miss when coding alone.

A concrete example: a PrestaShop site with a catalog mode on the homepage, a guest cart that converts into a prospect quote when the form is submitted, and a theme matching the existing showcase site's colors. Delivered in two days. Developments that, in a classic model, would have represented two weeks of work.

## What doesn't change

AI doesn't know your business. It doesn't know that your catalog is going to triple in six months, that your order process has an exception for long-standing clients, or that your shipping provider has undocumented behaviors that need handling.

That knowledge comes from years spent on real projects. And it's what determines whether what AI produces is acceptable or not, whether the chosen architecture will hold up over time, whether the delivered project will still be maintainable in two years.

The technology changes. Judgment remains the core value.
