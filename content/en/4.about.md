Freelance web developer in Rumilly, France — 20 years of experience

#intro
Independent web developer based in Rumilly, Haute-Savoie (74), France. With 20 years of experience, I operate under the Scriptami brand to support clients in their digital challenges. From PrestaShop to Nuxt, from API integrations to business applications, I rely on technologies I genuinely know. My role today: acting as an interpreter between your business needs and the possibilities of AI-assisted development. I structure, drive and control — so that technology serves your real goals, not the other way around.

I work mainly with small businesses that have a real problem to solve — not a spec sheet to execute. A kick-off meeting to understand the need, then regular exchanges until the solution is right. No pitch about AI: it's part of my practice across every aspect of a project, you'll mostly notice the difference in the results. More responsive than an agency, more solid than a junior — and when I make a technical call, it's because I know why.
