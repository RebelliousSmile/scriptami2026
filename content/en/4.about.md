Freelance web developer in Rumilly, France — 20 years of experience

#intro
Independent web developer based in Rumilly, Haute-Savoie (74), France. With 20 years of experience, I operate under the Scriptami brand to support clients in their digital challenges. From WordPress to Prestashop, from Next.js to Nuxt, I choose the right technology for each project. My role today: acting as an interpreter between your business needs and the possibilities of AI-assisted development. I structure, drive and control — so that technology serves your real goals, not the other way around.
