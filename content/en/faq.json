          "label": "What services do you offer?",
          "content": "I offer custom web development: showcase sites, e-commerce (Prestashop, WooCommerce), business applications, API integration and AI-assisted automation. I also support clients in getting to grips with their tools."
        },
        {
          "label": "Concretely, how do you work with your clients?",
          "content": "I act as an interpreter between their needs and the expanded possibilities of AI-assisted development. A client arrives with a vision — often vague, sometimes contradictory. My job is to clarify those needs and structure them so the AI can produce exactly what's expected. Then I inspect, validate, and refine. My role often spills firmly into quality control — it's an iterative process where the human must keep their eyes open and hands on the wheel."
        },
        {
          "label": "Do you work with AI?",
          "content": "Yes. I speak three languages fluently: the client's business needs, the various web disciplines, and the language of AI. My role is to make the AI understand not just what we want, but why we want it, in what context, with what constraints. It's a constant dialogue where I inspect, reformulate, and validate."
        },
        {
          "label": "What kind of clients do you work with?",
          "content": "I work with freelancers, SMEs and project owners looking for a trusted technical partner. I prefer projects aligned with values of transparency, usefulness and honesty."

        {
          "label": "How much does a project cost?",
          "content": "Every project is different. I work on a quote basis, after an initial discussion to understand your needs. Get in touch to talk it over."
        },
        {
          "label": "How does payment work?",
          "content": "I ask for a deposit before starting, with the balance due on delivery. Terms are set out in the quote and contract."

        {
          "label": "Are you available for maintenance?",
          "content": "Yes, I handle maintenance and ongoing development of projects I've built, and can take over existing projects depending on their state."

          "label": "How has your profession evolved over two decades?",
          "content": "Under the pressure of small revolutions that force us to relearn how to do our work. I started when the web was just finding its feet — the war between ASP and PHP, the dot-com bubble, the JS revolution where the frontend decided it could do backend too. And now AI, which offers to write the code for us. It can fill every role, as long as someone knows when it's working badly. My job has taken a new turn: I'm a conductor between AI and human needs."
        },
        {
          "label": "How do you stay in control given the speed of AI?",
          "content": "That's THE challenge! AI is like a brilliant but hyperactive intern — it comes back every 5 minutes with finished work. My solution? Paper. Yes, in 2025, writing still means something. It's my anchor. When I read printed specifications, I find the natural rhythm of human thought again. I can imagine, structure, and reflect without being rushed by the speed of the machine."
        },
        {
          "label": "How do you position yourself ethically with AI?",
          "content": "It's heartbreaking. Jacques Ellul warned against the false neutrality of technology. Every prompt has a carbon cost, every automation has social implications. My profession has no future without AI, and I'm forced to embrace it — but I see it as a professional tool, and I avoid using it in my personal life."

        },
        {
          "label": "What recharges you outside of the digital world?",
          "content": "Switching off screens is already a form of recharging. I don't limit myself to development: I managed the construction of my own home and developed shared therapy office spaces. These physical projects reconnect me to reality and decision-making. And of course — leisure, exercise, contemplation."

          "label": "Advice for those who want to work with AI without getting lost in it?",
          "content": "Get interested in neuroscience and brain plasticity. Use the time saved by new tools to learn new skills, set yourself new challenges you won't delegate to the machine. The more we're helped by machines, the more we must protect our own value — for our health, for our mental wellbeing."
