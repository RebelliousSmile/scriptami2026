  Entrepreneurs develop methods that make them efficient in their work — tasks performed sequentially with rigour toward the same result. In computer science, we call this a script. Digitising your activity means automating the repetitive parts of your work so you can focus on what requires analysis, finesse, and experimentation. The script becomes your ally when it delivers the same quality of output as yours, executed at machine speed.
